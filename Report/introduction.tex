\section{Introduction}
This is the introduction.
It is imported from the file \verb+introduction.tex+.

\subsection{Instructions}
\subsubsection{Making the PDF}
Run \verb+makePDF.sh+ (Linux, OS X) or \verb+makePDF.bat+ (Windows) in the terminal to make a pdf of the whole paper.
This script also takes care of changes to the bibliography, so you only need to run it once.

\subsubsection{Editing}
Each section of the paper has its own \verb+.tex+ file that is imported into the main \verb+ML_leaf_report.tex+ file, so the sections can be worked on simultaneously without messing up the main file (hopefully).

\subsubsection{Preamble}
Finally, the file \verb+preamble.sty+ contains all package imports in one place.
