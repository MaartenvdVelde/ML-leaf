In the study of plant life, specifically trees, one important characteristic is the recognition of leaves. Due to the wide variety of shapes in which leafs appear, as well as their ease of transportation and photography, they have become one of the chief methods to visually determine the species of a tree or other plant. Modern software applications on smartphones provide a way of performing classification of a leaf, in the field, within minutes of it being photographed.
For this assignment, we have developed a program with the goal of analyzing leaf images that were obtained from existing datasets of digitized leaf photographs. Features were extracted from each image using the scale- and rotation-invariant SIFT method, and were then filtered and clustered using a visual Bag of Words algorithm. The resulting feature sets were then classified using an artificial neural network to provide correct identification of the leaf\’s species. The performance of this system was gauged on accuracy, and then compared with other such implementations from the literature which differed in both classification method and dataset used.
