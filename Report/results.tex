\subsection{Parameters}
The optimal number of visual words used in the bag-of-words process was found to be 100.

\subsection{Neural network classifier}

\subsection{KNN classifier}
As with the neural network classifier, a maximum of 100 SIFT descriptors were extracted from each image.
A random subset of 100 of the files containing these descriptors was used for the clustering step in the bag-of-words process, in which the descriptors were mapped onto 100 clusters.
The classifier was run on the test data for values of $K$ ranging from 1 to 100.
The highest accuracy of 60.9\% was achieved with $K = 32$.

Classifications were considered correct if the ground truth class appeared in the top $T$ results.
Figure \vref{fig:knnresults} shows the accuracy of the KNN classifier at various values of $T$, with $K$ ranging from 1 to 100.
Performance remains more or less steady once $K$ is above 10.
The marginal gain in accuracy for larger values of $T$ decreases rapidly with $T$ --- the step from $T=4$ to $T=5$ only improves the classifier's performance very slightly.
