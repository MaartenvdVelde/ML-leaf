K-Means clustering steps:

1. Gather features into one file.
There is a separate text file for each image's extracted features.
Use the bash script concatenateFeatures.sh to concatenate the first N text files into a single file containing all features on one line (featuresN.fts).

2. Clustering.
Run the clustering algorithm with this command:

python kmeans.py [features file] [K]
e.g. python kmeans.py features500.fts 50

(where K is the number of clusters = visual words = length of input vector to NN)

3. Output.
The classifier produces a text file containing the cluster centers (each with a length of 128), as well as a picture of the first two dimensions (really only useful for testing).

4. Generate histograms for images.
Use generateHistogram.py to create a BoW histogram for an image that can be used as input for a NN:

python generateHistogram.py kmeans_centers_N9605_K10.txt 10874.txt
